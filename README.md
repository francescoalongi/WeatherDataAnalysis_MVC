# Weather Data Analysis
This project is a web application developed using the MVC pattern which is intended to store weather data into a database and provide statistical analysis based on them.

This project is part of a bigger one which has the purpose to make MVC observable. In order to do so the MVC pattern has been modified into oMVC. This last version of the same project can be found at [this link](https://github.com/nicologhielmetti/weatherdatanalysis_oMVC).
