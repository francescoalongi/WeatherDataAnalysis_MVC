# Weather Data Analysis
This project is a web application developed using the MVC pattern which is intended to store weather data into a database and provide statistical analysis based on them.

This version of the project has the same functionalities shown in the master branch, the only difference is that the RDBMS module interfaces with the web application directly, without Hibernate as a middle layer.
